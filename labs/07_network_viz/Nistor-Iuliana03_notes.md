# Lab 07 - Network Visualization and Interpretation

## Layout used
I used the **spring layout** (Fruchterman-Reingold), which naturally separates modules and makes hub genes easy to identify.

## Why visualization helps
Compared to numeric analysis in Lab 6 (correlation matrices, adjacency matrices), visualization reveals:

- clear separation of modules
- hub genes become visually obvious
- density of edges shows how tightly genes interact
- easier biological interpretation
- better understanding of global network structure

Visualization transforms abstract matrices into an intuitive picture.
